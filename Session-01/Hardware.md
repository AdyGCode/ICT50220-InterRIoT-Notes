# Hardware

## Required Hardware

For those who wish to continue their practice at home, then the following is the equipment we will use in class. This is an **optional purchase** for you as a student. 

We have found that many students want to explore outside of class, but unfortunately we are not able to supply the equipment for out of class activities. In this situation you are recommended to purchase the Super Starter Kit shown below.

**The cost of the kits increases with the number of components.**

> **IMPORTANT:** Always do a check on prices to ensure you are able to get the best value and delivery costs.
